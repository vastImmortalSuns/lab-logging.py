# lab-logging.py

This project is a WIP to create and blend a Python GUI made with Tkinter to Robert Chung's original script that allows SPU employees to log the hours they worked without using banner. hiss script can be found here: https://github.com/Altrum/LabLoggingScript

If one would like to test Robert's script, follow the instructions below:

  (1) Downloading the file
  
  (2) Hardcoding your SPU username and password into the values in lines 6 and 7.
  
  (3) Hardcoding the days you worked into the value in line 16.
  
  (4) Hardcoding the days and time you worked in lines 111-128.

  (5) Running the file.
  
 The GUI currently is very barebones as the scrollbar does not work and it has not blended with Robert's script. These are the two main things to work on.
