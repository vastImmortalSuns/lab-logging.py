# lab-logging.py
A script that allows SPU lab assistants to log their hours without having to use Banner.

This project aims to get Robert Chung's original script working again. His project can be viewed here: https://github.com/Altrum/LabLoggingScript

The main fix that currently needs to be solved is how to get Mechanize working. Mechanize is one of the packages that is necessary for this script's operation, and it is currently unrecognizable.

Once the scirpt gets up and running, one can test it by downloading the file and hardcoding your SPU username and password into the .py file as well as the days you worked and their respective hours. After this, run the file.
